Aircraft Maintenance AR is an interactive augmented reality app that showcases how AR can be used for aircraft inspection and repair training. Using a 3D jet model, users can scan the aircraft to detect randomly generated maintenance issues. Each issue is visually highlighted on the jet, and users can tap to view detailed problem descriptions along with step-by-step repair instructions. Fix animations and realistic feedback enhance the learning experience, while a built-in repair log tracks all completed fixes. The app includes manual rotation, zoom gestures, and a responsive interface, making it an engaging tool for education and simulation in aviation maintenance.
